# PythonGiftCardAudit
This hub is to store the code and notebooks used for Ad-Hoc audit requests resolved using Python.

The INCOMM_RunningSum.ipynb is the first audit request given. 
Head of the Gift Card Accounting Team was unable to tie out the data, given it was such a large file (>5GB). Additionally, the process needed to be iterative, such that it calculated the running subtotal at each record level. The file was too large to be loaded into excel, so I was asked to calculate the data and send back aggregated to the Gift Card team.
